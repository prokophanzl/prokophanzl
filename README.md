## P. Han≈æl

I'm currently pursuing a [MA in linguistics at the University of Zurich](https://www.linguistics-ma.uzh.ch/) with a concentration in Digital Linguistics.

### What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm working on AsTRiQue, an active machine learning-based framework that reduces the length of 2-alternative forced choice phonetic perception experiments. Check out the code and my thesis about it [here](https://github.com/prokophanzl/astrique).


### Past Projects
I've developed a German to Swiss German dictionary based on a language corpus. Not only does Swiss German have many varieties spoken in different parts of the country, but very few of those have a widely accepted orthography. My dictionary, therefore, provides the user with different acceptable spellings and their relative counts (with the option to sort by canton).
